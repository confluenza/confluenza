## Using External Content

This document uses a so called _External Content_ - which in this case is the contents of the `README.md`
file. As you see you can also type directly in the `CONFLUENZA.md` file and everything you add will
appended to the included external content.

> The name `CONFLUENZA.md` is not a requirement. Any file with a valid frontmatter on top will be processed by Confluenza and files without frontmatter will be ignored (unless included as the external content of course).
