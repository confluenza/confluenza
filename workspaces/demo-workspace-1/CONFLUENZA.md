## Using External Content

This document uses a so called _External Content_ - which in this case is the contents of the `README.md`
file. As you see you can also type directly in the `CONFLUENZA.md` file and everything you add will
appended to the included external content.

> The name `CONFLUENZA.md` is not a requirements. Any file with front matter on top will be processed by
> Confluenza and files without front matter will be ignored (unless included as the external content of 
course).
