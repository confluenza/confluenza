import { WithBorder, ImportingMDXDocuments } from '../../components/mdx'

[MDX](https://mdxjs.com) allows you to use JSX directly in your Markdown documents.

Imagine, you are documenting a component. Wouldn't it be nice to actually show a working component
directly in your Markdown document? I mean, not a screenshot, or code snippet, but real rendered
component. MDX makes it possible.

Below you see a component that renders its content with a border of the given thickness.

<WithBorder thickness={5}>
  This text should appear in a border `5px` thick.
</WithBorder>

This component is imported as any other regular react component with:

```javascript
import { WithBorder } from '../../components/mdx'
```

> The import statement must be placed directly after _frontmatter_ if one is used.

<ImportingMDXDocuments />

## Enabling MDX support in Confluenza

By default, MDX support in Confluenza is disabled. It means that even if you have supported
MDX documents in in the source tree, they will not be processed by Confluenza and will not be
rendered in the navigation menu.

> We assume that most of the repositories will use pure Markdown documents and in many cases there
will be no single MDX document. The way Gatsby plugins work, requires that there is at least one
document of the given type for the corresponding Gatsby plugin to create the resulting GraphQL nodes.
If this condition is not met, the compilation would fail. Without this default setup that disables
support for MDX, the user would be required to create a _dummy_ MDX document for the compilation
to succeed. We prefer to avoid this burden on the user.

In order to enable support for MDX, the user needs to provide the `mdx` parameter set to value `true` in
the `gatsby-config.js` file:

```javascript
{
  resolve: '@confluenza/gatsby-theme-confluenza',
  options: {
    mdx: true
  }
}
```

In Confluenza, you can use MDX documents the same way you use regular Markdown documents.
If you want your MDX document to be visible to Confluenza, just make sure it has a valid
frontmatter with a `path`, `title`, and `tag`. For MDX documents, Confluenza does not
support the `content` frontmatter attribute, but you can still import external content
into your MDX documents the way we show above by using a regular javascript `import` statement.
