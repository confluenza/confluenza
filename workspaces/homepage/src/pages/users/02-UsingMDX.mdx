import { WithBorder, ImportingMDXDocuments } from '../../components/mdx'

[MDX](https://mdxjs.com) allows you to use JSX directly in your Markdown documents.

Imagine, you are documenting a component. Wouldn't it be nice to actually show a working component
directly in your Markdown document? I mean, not a screenshot, or code snippet, but real rendered
component. MDX makes it possible.

Below you see a component that renders its content with a border of the given thickness.

<WithBorder thickness={5}>
  This text should appear in a border `5px` thick.
</WithBorder>

This component is imported as any other regular react component with:

```javascript
import { WithBorder } from '../../components/mdx'
```

> The import statement must be placed directly after _frontmatter_ if one is used.

<ImportingMDXDocuments />

In Confluenza, you can use MDX documents the same way you use regular Markdown documents.
If you want your MDX document to be visible to Confluenza, just make sure it has a valid
frontmatter with a `path`, `title`, and `tag`. For MDX documents, Confluenza does not
support the `content` frontmatter attribute, but you can still import external content
into your MDX documents the way we show above by using a regular javascript `import` statement.
