import { WithBorder, ImportingMDXDocuments } from '../../components/mdx'

[MDX](https://mdxjs.com) allows you to use JSX directly in your Markdown documents.

Imagine, you are documenting a component. Wouldn't it be nice to actually show a working component
directly in your Markdown document? I mean, not a screenshot, or code snippet, but real rendered
component. MDX makes it possible.

Below you see a component that renders its content with a border of the given thickness.

<WithBorder thickness={5}>
  This text should appear in a border `5px` thick.
</WithBorder>

This component is imported as any other regular react component with:

```javascript
import { WithBorder } from '../../components/mdx'
```

> The import statement must be placed directly after _frontmatter_ if one is used.

<ImportingMDXDocuments />

## Enabling MDX support in Confluenza

In Confluenza, you can use MDX documents the same way you use regular Markdown documents.
If you want your MDX document to be visible to Confluenza, just make sure it has a valid
frontmatter with a `path`, `title`, and `tag`. For MDX documents, Confluenza does not
support the `content` frontmatter attribute, but you can still import external content
into your MDX documents the way we show above by using a regular javascript `import` statement.

## When you do not have any MDX documents

Because of how Gatsby works, when there are no MDX documents,
neither MDX nodes nor the corresponding GraphQL types will be created. This will make Gatsby failing.

There are two solutions: first, make sure you do have MDX content. Just create a _dummy_ MDX document
with a frontmatter similar to this one:

```markdown
---
path: /dummy
title: Dummy
tag: dummy
---
```

The values do not relly matter, just make sure they do not conflict with your actual content and that `path`,
`title`, and `tag` attributes are defined.

Another approach would be add the following to your site's `gatsby-config.js`:

```javascript
exports.createSchemaCustomization = ({ actions }) => {
  const { createTypes, createFieldExtension } = actions
  createFieldExtension({
    name: 'noMdx',
    extend: () => ({
      resolve (source, args, context, info) {
        if (source[info.fieldName]) {
          return context.defaultFieldResolver(
            source,
            args,
            context,
            info
          )
        } else {
          return ''
        }
      }
    })
  })
  const typeDefs = `
    type Mdx implements Node @infer {
      frontmatter: MdxFrontmatter,
    }
    type MdxFrontmatter @infer {
      title: String @noMdx,
      path: String @noMdx,
      tag: String @noMdx
    }
  `
  createTypes(typeDefs)
}
```

Here we basicaly make sure that `Mdx` and `MdxFrontmatter` are defined with `title`, `path`, and `tag`.

> Unfortunatley, we could not just add this to `gatsby-node.js` of the `gatsby-theme-confluenza` package.
It would work in a source plugin, but is not allowed in themes.

> You will experience similar problems when your site has MDX but no single Markdown content.
This is far less probable that there is no single Markdown document in your source tree,
but in such a case, just make sure, you add a dummy Markdown file,
or you use a similar hack that we show above working for `Mdx` and `MdxFrontmatter` schema types.

`gatsby-theme-confluenza` also provides an option to disable support for MDX:

```javascript
{
  resolve: '@confluenza/gatsby-theme-confluenza',
  options: {
    mdx: false
  }
}
```

Notice though that you still
need to make sure that `Mdx` and `MdxFrontmatter` schema types are created - so even in the case you turn
support for MDX off, you still need to either use a dummy file, or update the GraphQL schema types in
your `gatsby-node.js`.
