This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app). 

It is a working demo of using [component-navigation-react] with `create-react-app` based React application.

As an example we deploy the demo-component-navigator app to GitHub pages. Notice, however, that GitHub pages are not really SPA-friendly when in comes to the client side routing. If you want to more more, and learn how this can be fixed for GitHub pages, please consult [Notes on client-side routing](https://create-react-app.dev/docs/deployment/#notes-on-client-side-routing) in the [Create React App documentation](https://create-react-app.dev). We did not bother for this simple demo.
