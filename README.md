## Confluenza Mono

Confluenza is a flexible Markdown documentation browser. Confluenza can get quite well on its own,
but it likes monorepos. For instance, you can use Confluenza to create your project's landing page
in one of the workspaces and use Confluenza's built-in, flexible markdown documentation browser to
conveniently browse all your markdown documents from other workspaces.

We are working to make Confluenza easier to use and better documented and if you would like to help
then [Contributions](https://react-frontend-developer.now.sh/developers/contributing) are welcomed!

This repository can be used as a working example of how to use Confluenza in a monorepo. It is fully
functional. You can start from here and have a ready to use monorepo with a working Confluenza setup in
one of the workspaces. Then just remove the stuff you do not need.
Adding Confluenza to an existing monorepo is easy, but not automated yet, which means you may need to make
sure that your setup is aligned with what Confluenza needs. We are working on making this process
automated.

We therefore recommend to get started by cloning this repository and learning the basics of Confluenza.
Please start with [Making Confluenza Yours](/developers/making-confluenza-yours).
